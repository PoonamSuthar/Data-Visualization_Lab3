For Q1, It was prepared in collaboration with my friend.Since it required around 180-200 manual entrirs.

For Question 1-This code creates a folium map and plots the population data for each state capital of India as a circle marker on the map.

For Question 2- This code creates a GeoDataFrame from a data_location dataframe, which should contain information about the latitude, longitude, and population of each city. The Point object from the Shapely library is used to create the geometry of the data, which is then stored in the GeoDataFrame gdf.
